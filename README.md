# Thunderbird Conversations (Modernized)

> **🎨 Modernized Fork**: This is a modernized version of the original [Thunderbird Conversations](https://github.com/thunderbird-conversations/thunderbird-conversations) extension, featuring native Thunderbird styling, streamlined interface, and improved user experience for Thunderbird 140+.

## ✨ What's Different in This Fork

This modernized version includes significant improvements over the original:

- **Native Thunderbird Styling**: Seamlessly integrates with Thunderbird's modern interface
- **Streamlined UI**: Removed clutter like QuickReply interface, star buttons, and unnecessary footers
- **System Integration**: Uses system accent colors and respects light/dark mode preferences
- **Cleaner Message Display**: Simplified attachment views and message headers
- **Modern Design Language**: Card-based layouts with subtle shadows and smooth animations
- **Reduced Complexity**: Removed legacy theming options that caused display issues

For a detailed list of changes, see [MODERNIZATION_PROGRESS.md](docs/MODERNIZATION_PROGRESS.md).

## 📧 About Thunderbird Conversations

This extension improves the threaded summary for emails in Thunderbird. It
vastly improves the UI by including some ideas from GMail. More specifically:

- your own messages are displayed in the thread,
- you initially see summaries, they can be expanded to display full messages,
- quoted sections are collapsed à la GMail,
- fast links for replying (and possibly other useful actions).

## 📦 Installation

**Original Extension**: For the original version, visit [AMO](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/)

**This Modernized Version**: Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/michalmielczynski/thunderbird-conversations/releases) page or build from source (see below).

## 🔧 Thunderbird Support

We try to ensure the released version of Conversations supports at least the
latest released Thunderbird version.

Where possible, we also support the previous Thunderbird version, and the latest
Beta's. However, sometimes support may lag, depending on what changes have
recently been made in Thunderbird.

**This modernized version targets Thunderbird 140+** for optimal native styling integration.
