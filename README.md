This modernized version includes significant improvements over the original:

### üé® Quick Filter Integration (v4.3.5)

The conversation header has been enhanced to match Thunderbird's native Quick Filter appearance:

## üìß About Thunderbird Conversations

This extension improves the threaded summary for emails in Thunderbird. It
vastly improves the UI by including some ideas from GMail. More specifically:

- your own messages are displayed in the thread,
- you initially see summaries, they can be expanded to display full messages,
- quoted sections are collapsed √† la GMail,
- fast links for replying (and possibly other useful actions).

## üì¶ Installation

**Original Extension**: For the original version, visit [AMO](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/)

**This Modernized Version**: Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/michalmielczynski/thunderbird-conversations/releases) page or build from source (see below).

## üîß Thunderbird Support

We try to ensure the released version of Conversations supports at least the
latest released Thunderbird version.

Where possible, we also support the previous Thunderbird version, and the latest
Beta's. However, sometimes support may lag, depending on what changes have
recently been made in Thunderbird.

**This modernized version targets Thunderbird 140+** for optimal native styling integration.
